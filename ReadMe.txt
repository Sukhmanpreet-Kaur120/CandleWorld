step 1: Read me created, added the github link.
step 2: created a page for Aboutus.
step 3: Did some changes in navigation bar so it could link.
step 4: Addeed a new class as Candle.cs.
Then after this add Nutget package and did scafolding, but in this i got error after figuring out the error solved it in like 8 mins.
Restarted the assignment as the error was still showing and in the second attempt it was solved as my mistake was spellings.
Gave commands in the migration and then tested it but its still not working and showing errors.
After half hour messing with the codes i started a new submission and this time the test run but there were some problems with about page so i went back and checked my spelling mistakes and then run it again this 
time it worked.
